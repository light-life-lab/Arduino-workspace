	<h1>iPhone Protocol for Sending Serial Datastream via Line-in Jack</h1>

	<h2>Thanks for downloading this bundle!</h2>
	<p>This collection of files provides the foundation to send a serial stream of data to the iPhone through the line-in 
	conductor of headphone jack from an Arduino micro-controller.  Although you could accomplish this feat with minimal 
	hardware, the following components are recommended, and will be referenced throughout this document:

	<p>A brief note: this project is in its infancy of development, and is are assuredly much room for improvement.  
	If you have any changes you'd like to make, please let me know or post the changes wherever you found this code 
	in the first place.

	<h2>Xcode Files</h2>
	<p>Below is a list of the files included in the main classes directory of the Xcode project of this download.
	A brief explination of each file is listed to the right.
	</p>

	<h3>Main Class Files</h3>
	<table cellspacing="4" cellpadding="4">
		<tr>
			<th>File Name</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><em>SineMaker</em> (h/m)</td>
			<td>Sine generator class which creates, plays and stops the sine wave(s), and adds an optional tremolo effect.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><em>avTouchController</em> (h/mm)</td>
			<td>Class borrowed from Apple's sample code; enables music playback (utilized on the MusicView).</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><em>WiiNunchuckAppDelegate</em> (h/mm)</td>
			<td>Application delegate, instantiates the MUEAudioIO object, as well as the SampleAudioUnit.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><em>MainViewController</em> (h/mm)</td>
			<td>Represents the "Synthesize" view in the app, reads all received values from input stream, declares sound
			objects to be played back, and monitors changing values while synced with the Arduino.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><em>SettingsViewController</em> (h/mm)</td>
			<td>Monitors all user-changeable parameters, including synth modes, use of iPhone acceleration, and number of sine tones.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><em>SampleAudioUnit</em> (h/mm)</td>
			<td>Audio-processing shell which parses the incomming stream of audio and breaks apart the pulses received into 
			intelligible binary values.  The values are also collected, averaged, and sent to the MainViewController from this file.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><em>AboutViewController</em> (h/m)</td>
			<td>View controller managing the AboutView (empty).</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><em>InfoViewController</em> (h/m)</td>
			<td>View controller managing the InfoView, consiting of a simple WebView and infoButton.</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	
	<p>Within the Xcode project's classes folder, two subgroups exist, each with its own files.  The <em>AVPlayback</em> 
	group contains files copied verbatim from a sample project available on Apple's developer website, and the contents of
	which are used for music playback on the <em>Music</em> tab of the iPhone application.  Therefore, I will not go
	detail describing code I did not write.
	</p>
	<p>The <em>MUEAudioIO</em> subgroup is a vital set of files which initializes the audio session and handles the input
	stream of audio from the currently active input route.
	</p>
	
	<h3>MUEAudioIO Files</h3>
