	<h1>iPhone Protocol for Sending Serial Datastream via Line-in Jack</h1>
	<h4><em>Thanks for downloading this bundle!</em></h4>

	<h2>Hardware</h2>
	<p>This collection of files provides the foundation to send a serial stream of data to the iPhone through the line-in 
	conductor of headphone jack from an Arduino micro-controller.  Although you could accomplish this feat with minimal 
	hardware, the following components are recommended, and will be referenced throughout this document:

	<p>A brief note: this project is in its infancy of development, and is are assuredly much room for improvement.  
	If you have any changes you'd like to make, please let me know or post the changes wherever you found this code 
	in the first place.
	</p>

	<h2>Software (included)</h2>
	<p>Below is a list of the files included in the main classes directory of the Xcode project of this download.
	A brief explination of each file is listed to the right.
	</p>

	<h3>Xcode: Main Class Files</h3>
	<table cellspacing="4" cellpadding="4">
		<tr>
			<th>File Name</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><em>SineMaker</em> (h/m)</td>
			<td>Sine generator class which creates, plays and stops the sine wave(s), and adds an optional tremolo effect.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><em>avTouchController</em> (h/mm)</td>
			<td>Class borrowed from Apple's sample code; enables music playback (utilized on the MusicView).</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><em>WiiNunchuckAppDelegate</em> (h/mm)</td>
			<td>Application delegate, instantiates the MUEAudioIO object, as well as the SampleAudioUnit.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><em>MainViewController</em> (h/mm)</td>
			<td>Represents the "Synthesize" view in the app, reads all received values from input stream, declares sound
			objects to be played back, and monitors changing values while synced with the Arduino.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><em>SettingsViewController</em> (h/mm)</td>
			<td>Monitors all user-changeable parameters, including synth modes, use of iPhone acceleration, and number of sine tones.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><em>SampleAudioUnit</em> (h/mm)</td>
			<td>Audio-processing shell which parses the incomming stream of audio and breaks apart the pulses received into 
			intelligible binary values.  The values are also collected, averaged, and sent to the MainViewController from this file.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><em>AboutViewController</em> (h/m)</td>
			<td>View controller managing the AboutView (empty).</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><em>InfoViewController</em> (h/m)</td>
			<td>View controller managing the InfoView, consiting of a simple WebView and infoButton.</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	
	<p>Within the Xcode project's classes folder, two subgroups exist, each with its own files.  The <em>AVPlayback</em> 
	group contains files copied verbatim from a sample project available on Apple's developer website, and the contents of
	which are used for music playback on the <em>Music</em> tab of the iPhone application.  Therefore, I will not go
	detail describing code I did not write.
	</p>
	<p>The <em>MUEAudioIO</em> subgroup is a set of files which initializes the audio session for the iPhone application, and handles the input
	stream of audio from the currently active input route.  A buffering structure is set up to allow for access to the incoming samples from within 
	the <em>SampleAudioUnit</em> file.  Much thanks to Chris Santoro who wrote this class, and was kind enough to pass it on to us.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Xcode: MUEAudioIO Files</h3>
	<table cellspacing="4" cellpadding="4">
		<tr>
			<th>File Name</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><em>Filter</em> (h/cpp)</td>
			<td>A class designed to implement a digital filter from a set of coefficients (difference equation).  This code is not 
			utilized by the Wii Nunchuck application.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><em>AudioBasics</em> (h/cpp)</td>
			<td>Constants set regarding the audio stream expected coming into the iPhone, as well as some utility functions for converting sample values.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><em>CADebugMacros</em> (h/cpp)</td>
			<td>"Helper class for printing debug messages"</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><em>CAStreamBasicDescription</em> (h/cpp)</td>
			<td>"Helper class for audio stream descriptions"</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><em>MUEAudioUnit</em> (h)</td>
			<td>This is the AudioUnit template which can be used to inspect the incoming audio stream frame-by-frame.  This shell is primarily
			designed to process audio with effects, but monitoring the input stream can be accomplished as well (as done in the Wii Nunchuck application).
			This is the class you will subclass to process your audio.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><em>MUEAudioIO</em> (h/cpp)</td>
			<td>Configures the audio session, as well as handles administrative callback functions such as route-changes, interrupt handling, and 
			preferred buffering sizes.</td>

	<p><a href="http://www.samdrazin.com">Sam Drazin</a> and <a href="http://ebertot.pbworks.com">Eddie Bertot</a> are a couple
	of lazy joes with not much more than a few bright ideas, and an overwhelming and constant thirst for beer.  Both recent
	graduates of the <a href="http://mue.music.miami.edu">Music Engineering</a> program of the <a href="http://www.miami.edu">University of Miami</a>,
	these two youngsters share interests in software/hardware hacking of audio equipment, playing jazz standards, and of course a Cuban pastelito
	every now and then.
	</p>
	
	<p>The protocol documented above represents a semester's worth of work for an
	<a href="mue.music.miami.edu/wiki/index.php/MMI593_DSP_for_Embedded_Music_Electronics_-_Spring_2010">Embedded Systems course</a> taught within the
	<a href="http://mue.music.miami.edu">Music Engineering</a> Department of the <a href="http://www.miami.edu">University of Miami</a>.  For more
	information on the project that fostered the development of this protocol, refer to <a href="http://www.samdrazin.com/classes/mmi593/finalproject">
	Sam's Project Website</a>.  The	course focused on introductory concerns in design and implementation of embedded systems, as well as several crash
	courses in platforms including the Arduino IDE (Wiring/Processing), Android, and iPhone.
