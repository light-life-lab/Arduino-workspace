<h3 align="left">The Wii Nunchuck App</h3>

<h4>Instructions for usage</h4>
<p>This application allows you to synchronize your iPhone or iPod Touch with a Wii Nunchuck.  The pairing
requires the use of an Arduino micro-controller, and several other pieces of hardware before the devices
will be fully in sync (a full parts list is available 
<a href="http://wwww.samdrazin.com/classes/mmi593/finalproject/partslist.txt">here</a>).<p>

<p>Once your setup is assembled, your iPhone can be controlled by the data stream sent out from a Wii
Nunchuck, which includes accelerometer information in 3 axes, joystick information in 2 axes, and the use
of the Z and C buttons.  This data can be mapped to control a variety of sounds, visual queues, or anything
else that is accessible through the iPhone SDK.<p>

<p>This app was created to attempt to bridge the gap between the conventional use of a touch-screen device
and more intuitive methods of control.  Designed for a DSP for Embedded Devices course at the University of
Miami, focus went into making the app AV-savvy, but there is no limit as to what an input stream of data
from an auxiliary control can provide for a creative user.</p>

<p>The method of data transfer is carried though the headphone jack into the line-in input of an iPhone.  
The protocol was designed and implemented by Eddie Bertot and myself for this (and other) iPhone-related
projects.  This method is assuredly a work-around from the standardized collection of approved iPhone
accessories, and is essentially a hack to get data into the device without the use of the 30-pin connector.  
For this reason, the data stream may be slightly noisy.  Ideally, updates in the future will improve the 
fidelity of information sent into the device.</p>

documentation on the system, check out the <a href="http://www.samdrazin.com/classes/mmi593/finalproject">website
